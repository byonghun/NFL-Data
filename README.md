# NFL-Data

Data extracted from Fantasy.NFL.com divided by season and player position,
along with weekly numbers for the 2021 season. 

The extract goes back to the 2015 season as that is the first available season
with a full dataset for all positions. 

Point total and player-ranks are specific for the MML leagues point system but 
all outer data are raw and can be used for other calculations and simulations. 

All data are available in comma-separated csv files or row-divided JSON.
